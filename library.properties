sentence=Allows communication with alphanumerical liquid crystal displays (LCDs), in a non-blocking way.
paragraph=Version of Arduino's LiquidCrystal with an internal queue, suitable for writing stuff asynchronously. This library allows an Arduino/Genuino board to control LiquidCrystal displays (LCDs) based on the Hitachi HD44780 (or a compatible) chipset, which is found on most text-based LCDs. The library works with in either 4 or 8 bit mode (i.e. using 4 or 8 data lines in addition to the rs, enable, and, optionally, the rw control lines).
